<div class="bi-line"> The Code Tinkerer, Misfit and All Round Adorable Arseshole</div>

I'm Johnny, I do things, and I sometimes don't things. I was born and currently still live on a pebble in the UK, a pebble called Jersey. It's a tiny, over-crowded pebble but it's my pebble. I work for a mail order/online company.

<li>I'm a gamer</li>
<li>I fix things</li>
<li>I break Things</li>
<li>Bunnies are evil</li>
<li>I 3D print things</li>
