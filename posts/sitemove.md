So I've completely moved this site over to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and
[Netlify](netlify.com) I'm a tinkerer at heart and tinkering with static a site generator
is a hell of a lot easier than tinkering with something like WordPress and other 
pre-built CMS' I won't bother going in to detail about the workings of it but if you're
relly all that interested feel free to check out the links.
